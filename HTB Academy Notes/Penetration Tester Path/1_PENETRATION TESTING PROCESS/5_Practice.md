# 5_Practice

To effectively apply and transfer knowledge into real-world situations, it is crucial to practice the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) learned in the Penetration Tester path. This helps keep our skills sharp and prepares us for potential customer engagements. Communication skills, both written and verbal, are equally essential for effective penetration testing.

Working with a team can help hone our skills, such as practicing leading a kickoff call or delivering a post-engagement report walkthrough briefing. Thorough documentation and strong reporting skills are also critical for credibility and making an impression on clients.

While a lengthy report provides more evidence to back up our work, it must be well-written and easy to follow. This module provides suggestions and resources for practicing this critical soft skill.

- **Note**: When working on a pentest team, we practiced client kickoff calls and report review meetings with each other. We drilled each other on our report content and recommendations, preparing to handle questions or disputes from clients. This practice will give you a more polished and professional look.

Practicing hands-on keyboard skills is as crucial as the client-facing portions of a penetration test. Reading is not a replacement for hands-on practice. Practicing will help us see what comes naturally to us and what areas we need to improve.

## ****Practicing Steps****

- 2x Modules
- 3x Retired Machines
- 5x Active Machines
- 1x Pro Lab / Endgame

## ****Modules****

When practicing modules, choose two different difficulty levels: `technical` and `offensive`. Use them to familiarize yourself with attacks and develop an understanding of them. Then use the exercises and machines provided to apply these techniques and create efficient notes and screenshots for accurate documentation.

| Step | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Read the module |
| 2. | Practice the exercises |
| 3. | Complete the module |
| 4. | Start the module exercises from scratch |
| 5. | While solving the exercises again, take notes |
| 6. | Create technical documentation based on the notes |
| 7. | Create non-technical documentation based on the notes |

Practice different modules to deal with various technologies and issues. Take detailed notes as some pairings of technologies and attack vectors can be rare. Create minor `technical` and `non-technical` documentation after completing the module to practice creating "client-ready" documentation. Practicing writing documentation can help cement topics in our minds and make it easier to explain concepts to technical and non-technical audiences.

## ****Retired Machines****

To practice, select three different retired machines with varying difficulty levels, **`two easy`** and **`one medium`**. You can find recommended retired machines at the end of each module to help practice specific tools and topics covered.  

| Step | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Get the user flag on your own |
| 2. | Get the root flag on your own |
| 3. | Write your technical documentation |
| 4. | Write your non-technical documentation |
| 5. | Compare your notes with the official write-up (or a community write-up) |
| 6. | Create a list of information you have missed |
| 7. | Watch https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA walkthrough and compare it with your notes |
| 8. | Expand your notes and documentation by adding the missed parts |

We should create technical and non-technical documentation again to cover more topics and improve our information capture. This approach helps us prepare better documentation based on our experiences and notes.

## ****Active Machines****

After building a good foundation with the modules and the retired machines, we can venture to `two easy`, `two medium`, and `one hard` active machine. 

Simulate a realistic situation using a single host that we have no familiarity with and cannot find documentation on. Ideal practice steps for active machines would look like this:

- Choose one machine
- Enumerate the machine
- Gain user access
- Escalate privileges
- Capture flags
- Document the steps and findings

After completing the steps, compare them with other write-ups or solutions.

| Step | Task |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Get the user and root flag |
| 2. | Write your technical documentation |
| 3. | Write your non-technical documentation |
| 4. | Have it proofread by technical and non-technical persons |

To create effective documentation, we need to proofread and identify areas for improvement. Our non-technical documentation should be `concise`, `informative`, and `free of jargon`.

## ****Pro Lab/Endgame****

Prolabs and Endgames simulate large multi-host environments similar to those we could run into during actual penetration tests. Attacking infrastructure with several interconnected hosts will create additional connections to consider in our documentation. We will need to practice writing up an entire attack chain, from foothold to network compromise.

## ****Wrapping Up****

It is important to continue the modules in the order presented to avoid knowledge gaps. Reviewing completed modules in the context of this module's process is also recommended. Continuous practice and improvement are vital, regardless of where you are in your journey. In the rapidly changing field of information technology, it's important to stay on top of the latest TTPs. Never stop learning and improving. Challenge yourself daily, take breaks, enjoy the journey, and don't forget to think outside the box.
