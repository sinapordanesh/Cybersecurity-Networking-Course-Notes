Infrastructures today are complex with multiple components, making effective management challenging. Ansible, an automation engine, helps with provisioning, configuring systems, deploying applications, and more.

This course aims to teach Ansible for automation. You'll learn to create playbooks for system administration and security tasks.

Using Ansible brings value by automating staging and production environment creation, ensuring consistency and reducing bugs.

Ansible's YAML-based playbooks are simple and expressive.
