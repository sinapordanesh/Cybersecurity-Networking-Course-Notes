# Privilege Escalation Attack

The `getuid` command is commonly used in privilege escalation attacks to retrieve the user ID of the current user and gain access to sensitive data if executed with elevated privileges. System administrators should regularly update their systems and networks to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited in such attacks and limit user privileges to prevent unauthorized access.

Another command commonly used in privilege escalation attacks is `list_tokens -u`, which can be used to list the various security tokens associated with the current user and identify any that might be used to elevate privileges. It is important to monitor for and address vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to execute these commands and escalate their privileges.

The `impersonate_token` command is another tool used in privilege escalation attacks. It allows an attacker to impersonate the security context of another user and gain elevated privileges. It is important to monitor for and address vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to execute this command and escalate their privileges.
