# SSL/TLS Protocols and TLS Handshake

## HTTP and HTTPS

- HTTP is an application-layer protocol that is used to transfer data in the form of web pages and other types of files. It is responsible for formatting and structuring the data that is sent and received between a client and a server.
- HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an extension of HTTP that adds an additional layer of security by encrypting the sent and received data between a client and a server.
- HTTPS uses the same commands and rules as HTTP, but it adds an extra layer of security by encrypting the data using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer
Security (TLS) certificate.

## SSL and TLS Protocols

- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are both cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over networks. They are used to secure a variety of applications, including web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voiceover IP (VolP).
- The main difference between SSL and TLS is that SSL is now considered to be
obsolete and insecure, and it has been replaced by TLS.
