## What is Wireshark?

- Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer.
- It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.
- Wireshark is cross-platform, meaning it is available for various operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
- Wireshark is a powerful tool that allows you to capture and analyze packets in realtime or offline from a variety of sources, including wired and wireless networks, USB devices, and more.
- It can be used to examine a variety of protocols, including TCP, IP, HTTP, FTP, and
many others.
- One of the key features of Wireshark is its ability to display packets in a human-readable format, making it easy to understand the data being transmitted. It also provides a range of powerful filtering options, allowing you to focus on specific packets or patterns of interest.
- In addition to its packet capture and analysis capabilities, Wireshark also includes a range of tools for generating and manipulating packets, as well as tools for protocol dissectors and statistics.

- **Statistics:** This section provides various statistical information about the captured packets, such as the number of packets, bytes, and protocols. It also includes several sub-sections, including:
    - **Conversations:** This sub-section displays a summary of the conversations between endpoints, including the number of packets, bytes, and duration of each conversation. It can be used to identify which endpoints are communicating the most and to identify any unusual or suspicious activity.
    - **Endpoints:** This sub-section displays a summary of the endpoints in the captured traffic, including their IP and MAC addresses. It can be used to identify the devices and hosts on the network and to filter packets by endpoint.
    - **Protocol Hierarchy:** This sub-section displays a summary of the protocols used in the captured packets, organized in a hierarchical format. It can be used to identify which protocols are being used the most and to drill down into the packets for each protocol.
    - **I/O graphs:** This sub-section displays graphs of the input/output traffic over time. It can be used to identify trends and patterns in the traffic, such as spikes or dips in usage.
    - **Flow graph:** This sub-section displays a graphical representation of the packet flow between endpoints. It can be used to visualize the network traffic and to identify any unusual or suspicious activity.

# Features and Ads of the Wireshark App

- Free and Open Source:
    - Wireshark is a free and open-source network packet analyzer.
- Capture and Display Packets in Real-Time:
    - Wireshark captures packets from a network interface and displays them in real-time, allowing you to see what is happening on your network as it happens. You can also save the packet capture to a file and analyze it later.
- Filter Packets:
    - Wireshark allows you to filter packets based on various criteria, such as the source or destination address, the protocol being used, or the packet's content.
    - This makes it easy to focus on the packets that are most relevant to your analysis.
- Decode and Dissect Packets:
    - Wireshark can decode and dissect packets using a variety of protocols, including TCP, UDP, and HTTP. This allows you to see the details of each packet and understand how it fits into the overall communication.
- Graphical User Interface:
    - Wireshark has a user-friendly graphical interface that makes it easy to use, even for people who are new to packet analysis.
- Cross-Platform:
    - Wireshark is available for a variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOs, and Linux, making it a flexible tool that can be used on a wide range of devices.
- Extensive Protocol Support:
    - Wireshark supports a wide range of protocols, including common protocols like TCP, UDP, and HTTP.
    - It also supports many different media types, such as Ethernet, WiFi, PPP, and more.
- Customizable:
    - Wireshark allows you to customize the way it displays packets and performs the analysis. You can use colouring rules to highlight packets based on specific criteria, create custom columns to display additional packet information and use plugins to extend the functionality of Wireshark.
