# Linux File System

The Linux file system is structured in a hierarchical tree-like structure. The root directory is the top-most directory in the file system hierarchy. All other directories and files are located under the root directory or its subdirectories.

Here's a brief overview of the main Linux directory structure:

```
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var

```

- **/ (root)**: The top-most directory in the Linux file system hierarchy.
- **/bin**: Contains essential binary files for system boot and operation.
- **/boot**: Contains files required for booting the operating system, including the kernel, initial RAM disk, and boot loader configuration files.
- **/dev**: Contains device files that represent hardware devices connected to the system.
- **/etc**: Contains **system configuration** files used by various applications and services on the system.
- **/home**: Contains home directories for users to store their personal files and settings.
- **/lib**: Contains shared library files required by the system and other applications.
- **/media**: Contains mount points for removable media devices such as USB drives, CD-ROMs, etc.
- **/mnt**: Used to mount file systems temporarily.
- **/opt**: Contains optional software packages that are not part of the default system installation.
- **/proc**: Provides a virtual file system interface to system and process information.
- **/root**: The home directory for the root user.
- **/run**: Contains runtime data for system services and applications.
- **/sbin**: Contains essential system binaries that are used for system maintenance and administration.
- **/srv**: Contains data for services provided by the system.
- **/sys**: Contains a virtual file system interface to system and hardware information.
- **/tmp**: Contains temporary files created by various applications and services.
- **/usr**: Contains user binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for the system.
- **/var**: Contains variable data files, such as log files and spool directories, which are expected to grow in size during the lifetime of the system.

Understanding this hierarchy is essential for navigating and managing the file system in Linux.
