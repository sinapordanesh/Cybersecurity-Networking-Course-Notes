# Web Hackerâ€™s Toolbox: Tools Used by Successful Hackers

This course covers powerful techniques for security testing, including SQL injection detection and exploitation using Sqlmap, leveraging Google Hacking to uncover web application vulnerabilities, performing fuzzing with Burp Suite Intruder for vulnerability detection, and exploiting race conditions with OWASP ZAP. By the end of the course, you'll have a solid understanding of these techniques and their application in modern web application security.
