# 14_Symbolic Links

Symbolic links in Linux are files that act as pointers to another file or directory. They are similar to shortcuts in Windows. A symbolic link is a special type of file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path. When you access a symbolic link, it redirects you to the original file or directory.

## Creating Symbolic Links

To create a symbolic link, you can use the `ln` command with the `-s` option, followed by the original file or directory and the desired name and location of the symbolic link. For example, to create a symbolic link to a file named `file1` in the current directory with the name `link1`, you can use the following command:

```
ln -s file1 link1

```

## Viewing Symbolic Links

To view the contents of a symbolic link, you can use the `ls` command with the `-l` option. The output will show the original file or directory that the symbolic link points to, along with other information such as the file permissions and modification time. For example, to view the details of the `link1` symbolic link created in the previous example, you can use the following command:

```
ls -l link1

```

## Deleting Symbolic Links

To delete a symbolic link, you can use the `rm` command followed by the name of the symbolic link. For example, to delete the `link1` symbolic link created in the previous example, you can use the following command:

```
rm link1

```

## Conclusion

Symbolic links are a useful feature in Linux that can simplify file management and organization. They provide a way to access files and directories without having to navigate through complex directory structures. By using symbolic links, you can create shortcuts to important files and directories and easily share them with others.
