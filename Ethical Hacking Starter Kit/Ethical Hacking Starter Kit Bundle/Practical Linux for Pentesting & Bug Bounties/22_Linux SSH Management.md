# 22_Linux SSH Management

To connect to a Linux server via SSH, you can use the following command in the terminal: `ssh username@server_address`. Replace `username` with your username on the server, and `server_address` with the IP address or domain name of the server. You will then be prompted to enter your password for the server.

To modify SSH configuration, edit the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file with a text editor like vi or nano. For example, to edit with nano: `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`. After making the necessary changes, save and exit the editor. Restart the SSH server with `sudo systemctl restart sshd` to apply the changes.

The `-p` flag is used to specify the port number for the SSH connection. By default, SSH uses port 22, but if the server is configured to use a different port, you can specify it with `-p`. For example, `ssh -p 2222 username@server_address` would connect to the server at `server_address` on port 2222 instead of the default port 22.
