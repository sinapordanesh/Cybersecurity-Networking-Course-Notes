sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd

This command opens the `sshd` file in the `/etc/pam.d` directory for editing using the nano text editor with superuser privileges. The PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) configuration file sshd is responsible for authenticating users connecting via SSH. This file determines the authentication mechanisms that are used to authenticate the users, such as passwords or keys. 

```bash
echo "Testing PAM EXEC: PAM_RHOST=$PAM_RHOST, PAM_RUSER=$PAM_RUSER, PAM_SERVICE=$PAM_SERVICE, PAM_TTY=$PAM_TTY, PAM_USER=$PAM_USER, PAM_TYPE=$PAM_TYPE" >> /tmp/pam_test.log
```

The code above is a bash command that writes a message to a log file. The message contains information about the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) module, which is used for authentication purposes in Linux. The information includes the hostname of the remote client (`PAM_RHOST`), the username of the remote client (`PAM_RUSER`), the name of the service (`PAM_SERVICE`), the name of the terminal (`PAM_TTY`), the username of the currently authenticated user (`PAM_USER`), and the type of authentication (`PAM_TYPE`). The message is appended to a file located at `/tmp/pam_test.log`. This command is used for testing purposes to verify that PAM is working correctly.

**`sudo iptables -L -n —line-numbers`** 

This command lists all currently active iptables rules, with line numbers.

Here is an example of the output of the `sudo iptables -L -n —line-numbers` command:

```bash
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
num  target     prot opt source               destination
1    ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:22
2    ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:80
3    DROP       all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0

Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
num  target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
num  target     prot opt source               destination

```

The output is divided into three "chains" which specify the type of traffic to which the rules apply: `INPUT`, `FORWARD`, and `OUTPUT`. The `INPUT` chain is for incoming traffic, `FORWARD` is for traffic that is being forwarded through the system, and `OUTPUT` is for outgoing traffic.

Each rule is numbered for reference and corresponds to a particular action. For example, rule number `1` accepts incoming traffic on port `22` (SSH), and rule number `2` accepts incoming traffic on port `80` (HTTP). The "policy" of the chain is also shown, which is what happens to traffic that doesn't match any of the rules. In this case, the policy for the `INPUT` and `FORWARD` chains is `DROP`, which drops all traffic not explicitly allowed by the rules. The policy for the `OUTPUT` chain is `ACCEPT`, which allows all traffic by default.

The `sudo iptables -L -n —line-numbers` command is useful for viewing the currently active rules on a Linux firewall and debugging issues with network traffic.

### `Hands-on-Linux-for-DevOps-Cloud-Engineers/section6/enable_firew`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# simple host-based firewall that only allows SSH and HTTP in
# and DROPS the rest

sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
```

- `sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP`: This sets the default policy for incoming traffic to `DROP`, which means that all incoming traffic that doesn't match any of the following rules will be dropped.
- `sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT`: This command adds a rule to the `INPUT` chain that accepts incoming traffic that is part of an existing connection (i.e., traffic that is `ESTABLISHED` or `RELATED`), which is necessary for allowing legitimate traffic to return from a server.
- `sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT`: This command adds a rule to the `INPUT` chain that accepts incoming traffic on the loopback (`lo`) interface, which is necessary for some applications to communicate with other applications on the same system.
- `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT`: This command adds a rule to the `INPUT` chain that accepts incoming traffic on port `22` (SSH) using the TCP protocol.
- `sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT`: This command adds a rule to the `INPUT` chain that accepts incoming traffic on port `80` (HTTP) using the TCP protocol.
- `sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP`: This command adds a rule to the `INPUT` chain that drops all other incoming traffic that doesn't match any of the above rules.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This disables the firewall and resets the chain policies

sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
sudo iptables -F
```

- `sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT`: This sets the default policy for incoming traffic to `ACCEPT`, which means that all incoming traffic that doesn't match any of the following rules will be accepted.
- `sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT`: This sets the default policy for outgoing traffic to `ACCEPT`, which means that all outgoing traffic that doesn't match any of the following rules will be accepted.
- `sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP`: This sets the default policy for forwarding traffic (traffic that is being routed through the system) to `DROP`, which means that all forwarding traffic that doesn't match any of the following rules will be dropped.
- `sudo iptables -F`: This flushes (deletes) all rules in all chains. This is useful for resetting the firewall to a known state.

These commands are used to disable the firewall and reset the chain policies. The first two commands set the default policies for incoming and outgoing traffic to `ACCEPT`, which effectively disables the firewall. The third command sets the default policy for forwarding traffic to `DROP`, which means that all traffic being routed through the system will be dropped. Finally, the `sudo iptables -F` command flushes all rules from all chains, effectively resetting the firewall to a known state.

# Logging and Auditting

**`sudo auditctl -w /usr/local/engineering -p wa -k engineering-modify`**

This command sets up a watch on the `/usr/local/engineering` directory and logs any changes to files within that directory. The `-w` option specifies the directory to watch, and the `-p` option specifies the permissions to monitor. In this case, `-p wa` specifies that writes (`w`) and attribute changes (`a`) should be logged. The `-k` option specifies a kernel key that can be used to search for audit records related to this watch. In this case, the key is `engineering-modify`. This command is used for auditing purposes to monitor changes to a directory and track potentially suspicious activity.

`**sudo ausearch -f /us/local/engineering/malicious.txt**`

The command above searches the audit logs for events related to the file `/us/local/engineering/malicious.txt`. This command can be used to investigate potential security breaches or suspicious activity on a Linux system.

`**sudo aureport**` 

is a command used to generate a summary report of audit events on a Linux system. This can be useful for monitoring system activity and detecting security breaches. The report includes information such as the number of events for each event type, the users and terminals involved, and the event timestamp. The output can be customized using various options, such as filtering by time range or event type.

**`sudo journalctl -u sshd -u systemd-logind -r —since=yesterday`**

This command will show the system journal, including messages from the `sshd` and `systemd-logind` services, in reverse chronological order (`-r`) since yesterday:

# Hardening your SSH Server

we can apply above rules on the following file. 

The `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file has system-wide settings for the OpenSSH client, including default behavior, authentication and encryption algorithms, and authentication attempts allowed. The `sshd_config` file contains OpenSSH server configuration settings.

Use `sshd -T` command to display the current configuration of the `sshd` daemon.

`sudo systemctl restart sshd.service` is a command used to restart the SSH daemon on a Linux system. This can be useful for applying changes made to the SSH configuration file, such as `sshd_config`.
