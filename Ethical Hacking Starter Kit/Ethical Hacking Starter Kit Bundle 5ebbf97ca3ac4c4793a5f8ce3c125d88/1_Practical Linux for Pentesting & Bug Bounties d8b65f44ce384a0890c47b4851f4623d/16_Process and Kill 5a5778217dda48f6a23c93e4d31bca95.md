# 16_Process and Kill

# Basic Process and Kill Commands

Use `ps` to list all running processes, `ps -u {username}` to filter by user, and `ps -ef` for more detailed info. Use `kill {PID}` to terminate a process and `pkill {name}` to kill by name. Always verify the process ID or name before killing a process as it can cause system instability or data loss.

## `ps` Command

The `ps` command is used to list information about running processes.

You can also use the `ps aux` command to list all running processes with their associated usernames and resource utilization information.

To use the `kill` command, you must first determine the process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate using the `ps` command. Once you have the PID, you can use the `kill` command with the PID as an argument to terminate the process. For example, to terminate a process with a PID of 1234, you would run the command `kill 1234`. If the process does not terminate after sending the `kill` signal, you can use the `-9` option to forcefully terminate it with the command `kill -9 {PID}`. Remember to always verify the process ID before killing a process.

Here's an example of using `ps` and `kill` to terminate a process with a specific name:

```
# List all processes with the name "my_process"
ps -ef | grep my_process

# This will output a list of processes that matched the search criteria.
# Look for the process ID (PID) in the second column of the output.

# Terminate the process by its PID
kill {PID}

```

Replace `{PID}` with the actual process ID found in the output of the `ps` command. This will send a termination signal to the process, allowing it to clean up and exit gracefully. If the process does not respond to the termination signal, you can use the `-9` option with `kill` to forcefully terminate it. For example, `kill -9 {PID}`.

## `killall` Command

Please note that it is not recommended to use the `killall` command as it may terminate multiple processes with the same name, potentially causing unintended consequences. It is safer to use the `pkill` command instead to kill processes by name. To use `pkill`, simply specify the name of the process you want to terminate as an argument, like this: `pkill {name}`. Replace `{name}` with the actual name of the process you want to terminate.

### `ps aux | grep nano`

This command will list all running processes with their associated usernames and resource utilization information, and then filter the list by the name "nano". The command is `ps aux | grep nano`.
