# 9_Performance Monitoring

# Commands 1

## Using the `top` command for system performance monitoring in Linux

The `top` command provides a real-time view of the processes running on your system and their resource utilization. It lists processes by CPU usage and displays system information such as load average. Other Linux tools for monitoring performance include those for disk usage and network traffic.

Another Linux tool for performance monitoring is the `htop` command. It is similar to `top` but provides a better user interface with more interactive features. For example, it allows you to scroll horizontally and vertically to view process details, sort processes by various criteria, and filter processes by name or other parameters.

## Using the `mapstat 1` command for memory allocation statistics in Solaris

`mapstat 1` is a Solaris command that displays the statistics for the kernel's memory allocator. It shows the number of free and allocated memory blocks and the amount of memory used for each allocation size. It is useful for diagnosing problems related to memory usage and allocation.

## Using the `vmstat 1` command for memory allocation statistics in Linux

The `vmstat 1` command is a Linux command that provides a real-time view of virtual memory statistics, including information on memory usage, paging, and block I/O. It is useful for diagnosing performance issues related to memory allocation and usage.

## Using the `iostat 1` command for disk I/O statistics in Linux

The `iostat 1` command is a Linux command that provides a real-time view of CPU, disk I/O, and NFS statistics. It is useful for diagnosing performance issues related to disk I/O and identifying processes that are causing high disk I/O utilization.

## Using the `cat /var/log/syslog` command for system event logs in Linux

The `cat /var/log/syslog` command is a Linux command that displays the system log file. It contains information about system events, errors, and warnings. It can be useful for troubleshooting system issues and identifying problems with system services and applications.

To get the last 100 lines of the system log file in Linux, you can use the `tail` command with the `-n` option to specify the number of lines to display. The command would look like this:

```
tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog

```

This will display the last 100 lines of the `syslog` file. You can adjust the number of lines by changing the value after the `-n` option.

# Commands 2

## Using the `lsof` command for open files and processes in Linux

The `lsof` command is a Linux command that lists all open files and the processes that opened them. It provides details such as the process ID (PID) and user, file type, file size, and file access mode. It can be used to identify which processes are using specific files, sockets, or network connections.

To list all open files, you can run the following command:

```
lsof

```

This will display a list of all open files and the processes that opened them. You can filter the results by file name, PID, user, or other parameters using various options with the `lsof` command.

## Using the `free` command for memory usage statistics in Linux

The `free` command is a Linux command that displays information about the system's memory usage. It shows the total amount of available and used physical memory, as well as the amount of swap space used. This command can be useful for diagnosing performance issues related to memory usage and identifying processes that are causing high memory utilization.

To display the memory usage in human-readable format, you can use the following options:

- `free -h`: display the memory usage in GB, MB, and KB
- `free -g`: display the memory usage in GB
- `free -m`: display the memory usage in MB

For example, to display the memory usage in GB, you can run the following command:

```
free -g

```

This will display the total amount of available and used physical memory and swap space in gigabytes.

# `df` command

The `df` command is a Linux command that displays information about the file system usage on the system. It shows the amount of disk space used, available, and total for each mounted file system.

## Displaying the Information in Human-Readable Format

To display the information in human-readable format, you can use the following options:

- `df -h`: display the information in GB, MB, and KB
- `df -g`: display the information in GB
- `df -m`: display the information in MB

For example, to display the information in GB, you can run the following command:

```
df -g

```

This will display the amount of disk space used, available, and total for each mounted file system in gigabytes. You can also filter the results by file system type, exclude certain file systems, or display the information in a different format using other options.
