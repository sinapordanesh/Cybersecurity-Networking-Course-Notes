## `tar` Command

Here is a summary of the `tar` options and their examples:

- `tar cf {archive-filename} {file-or-directory-to-be-archived}`: creates a new archive and writes it to a file. For example, `tar cf myfiles.tar .` creates an archive named `myfiles.tar` containing all files and subdirectories in the current directory.
- `tar xvf {archive-filename}`: extracts files from an existing archive and writes them to disk. For example, `tar xvf myfiles.tar` extracts all files and subdirectories from the archive named `myfiles.tar` to the current directory.
- `tar czf {archive-filename} {file-or-directory-to-be-archived}`: creates a new compressed archive and writes it to a file. For example, `tar czf myfiles.tar.gz .` creates a compressed archive named `myfiles.tar.gz` containing all files and subdirectories in the current directory.
- `tar xzf {archive-filename}`: extracts files from an existing compressed archive and writes them to disk while also uncompressing them. For example, `tar xzf myfiles.tar.gz` extracts all files and subdirectories from the compressed archive named `myfiles.tar.gz` to the current directory, while also uncompressing them.
- `tar -cjf {archive-filename} {file-or-directory-to-be-archived}`: creates a new compressed archive using the bzip2 algorithm and writes it to a file. For example, `tar -cjf myfiles.tar.bz2 .` creates a compressed archive named `myfiles.tar.bz2` containing all files and subdirectories in the current directory using the bzip2 algorithm.
