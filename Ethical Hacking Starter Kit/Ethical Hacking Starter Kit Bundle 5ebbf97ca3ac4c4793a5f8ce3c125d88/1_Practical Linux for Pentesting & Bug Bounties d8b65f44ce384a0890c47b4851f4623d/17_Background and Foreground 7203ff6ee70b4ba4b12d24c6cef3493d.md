# Running Commands in the Background on Linux

You can run commands in the background on the Linux command line by appending an '`&`' symbol to the end of the command. This allows you to use the terminal while the command runs.

To check the status of background commands, use the 'jobs' command. To bring a background job to the foreground, use the '`fg`' command followed by the job number.

In summary, running commands in the background is a useful technique on the Linux command line.
