# 10_Userinfo and Management

# Commands

### ID Command

To retrieve a user's ID, you can use the `id` command. For example, in a Linux terminal, you can type `id` and press enter to display the current user ID and group ID.

### 'last' command

To display a list of recently logged-in users, you can use the `last` command. This command will show the user's name, the terminal used to log in, the date and time of the login, and other information.

### Who Command

The `who` command displays a list of users currently logged into the system, including their username, terminal, and login time.

### Creating a new group with groupadd command

To create a new group called "test", you can use the `groupadd` command. This command adds a new group entry to the system's group file, located at `/etc/group`.

Here's an example of how to use the `groupadd` command to create a new group called "test":

```
groupadd test

```

After running this command, the new group "test" will be created in the system. You can check this by opening the `/etc/group` file and looking for the "test" group entry.

### Creating a new user with the useradd command

To create a new user account called `<username>` with the name `<name>` and a home directory, you can use the `useradd` command with the `-c` and `-m` options. Here's an example of how to use this command:

```
useradd -c "<name>" -m <username>

```

After running this command, the new user account will be created with the specified name and home directory. You can check this by using the `id` command to display the user's ID and group ID, or by looking in the `/etc/passwd` file for the new user entry.

## usermod -aG sales <name> command

The `usermod -aG sales <name>` command adds an existing user to the "sales" group. The `-a` option tells the `usermod` command to append the group to the user's existing group memberships, rather than replacing them. The `-G` option specifies that the following argument is a list of groups to which the user should belong. After running this command, the user will have access to any files or directories that are only accessible to members of the "sales" group.
