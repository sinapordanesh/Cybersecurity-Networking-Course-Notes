# 8_Linux Hardware Information

# Using the history command

To display a list of previously executed commands in the terminal, you can use the `history` command. This tool can help maintain a record of executed commands and troubleshoot issues.

To use `history`, open a terminal window and type `history`. It will show a list of previously executed commands along with their command numbers. To rerun a specific command, type `!` followed by the command number. For example, to rerun a command with the number `42`, type `!42`.

Overall, `history` is a useful tool for managing a Linux system and keeping track of previously executed commands.

## Linux Hardware Information - `dmesg` command

Another useful command for managing Linux hardware information is the `dmesg` command. This command displays messages from the kernel ring buffer, which contains information about device drivers and hardware events.

To use `dmesg`, open a terminal window and type `dmesg`. It will show a list of hardware events and errors that have occurred since the last boot. You can also use options with `dmesg` to filter the output or display specific types of events.

Overall, `dmesg` is a useful tool for troubleshooting hardware issues and understanding the state of a Linux system's hardware components.

## Linux Hardware Information - `/proc/cpuinfo` command

The `/proc/cpuinfo` command is a useful tool for displaying detailed information about a Linux system's CPU. To use this command, open a terminal window and type `cat /proc/cpuinfo`. The output will include information about the processor type, clock speed, cache size, and other relevant details.

Overall, `/proc/cpuinfo` is a useful tool for understanding the capabilities and specifications of a Linux system's CPU.

## Linux Memory Information - `cat /proc/meminfo` command

To display information about a Linux system's memory usage, you can use the `cat /proc/meminfo` command. This command displays detailed information about the system's memory, including total memory, free memory, and memory usage by different processes.

To use `cat /proc/meminfo`, open a terminal window and type `cat /proc/meminfo`. The output will include information about the system's total memory, available memory, and other relevant details.

Overall, `cat /proc/meminfo` is a useful tool for understanding a Linux system's memory usage and diagnosing potential memory-related issues.

## Linux Memory Information - `free -h`, `free -g`, and `free -m` commands

To display information about free memory on a Linux system, you can use the `free -h`, `free -g`, or `free -m` commands.

- `free -h` displays the amount of free and used memory in human-readable format, as well as information about swap memory, in terms of gigabytes.
- `free -g` displays the amount of free and used memory in human-readable format, as well as information about swap memory, in terms of gigabytes.
- `free -m` displays the amount of free and used memory in human-readable format, as well as information about swap memory, in terms of megabytes.

To use these commands, open a terminal window and type the command you prefer. The output will include information about the system's total memory, used memory, and available memory.

Overall, these `free` commands are useful tools for quickly understanding a Linux system's memory usage and identifying potential memory-related issues.

### `lspci -tv`

To display detailed information about the PCI buses and devices in a Linux system, you can use the `lspci -tv` command. This command displays a tree view of the system's PCI devices and their connection to the PCI buses.

To use `lspci -tv`, open a terminal window and type `lspci -tv`. The output will include information about the system's PCI devices, such as the vendor and device IDs, as well as information about the devices' connections to the PCI buses.

Overall, `lspci -tv` is a useful tool for understanding the PCI devices in a Linux system and diagnosing potential hardware-related issues.

## Linux USB Information - `lsusb -tv` command

To display detailed information about the USB buses and devices in a Linux system, you can use the `lsusb -tv` command. This command displays a tree view of the system's USB devices and their connection to the USB buses.

To use `lsusb -tv`, open a terminal window and type `lsusb -tv`. The output will include information about the system's USB devices, such as the vendor and device IDs, as well as information about the devices' connections to the USB buses.

Overall, `lsusb -tv` is a useful tool for understanding the USB devices in a Linux system and diagnosing potential hardware-related issues.

# Linux File System Information - `df` command

The `df` command is a useful tool for displaying information about file systems in a Linux system. To use this command, open a terminal window and type `df`. The output will include information about the file systems, such as the device name, total size, used space, available space, and mount point.

Overall, `df` is a useful tool for understanding the file systems in a Linux system and diagnosing potential storage-related issues.
