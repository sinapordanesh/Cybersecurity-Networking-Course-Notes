# 13_Rename, Move, and Case Sensitive

- Linux is case-sensitive in terms of commands

Linux is case-sensitive in terms of commands. This means that commands entered in all caps, such as `CD`, will not work and must be entered in lowercase, such as `cd`.

For example, the command `ls` lists the contents of a directory and works as expected, but if you enter `LS` instead of `ls`, you will receive an error message stating that the command was not found. Similarly, the command `mkdir` creates a new directory and works as expected, but if you enter `MKDIR` instead of `mkdir`, you will receive an error message stating that the command was not found.
