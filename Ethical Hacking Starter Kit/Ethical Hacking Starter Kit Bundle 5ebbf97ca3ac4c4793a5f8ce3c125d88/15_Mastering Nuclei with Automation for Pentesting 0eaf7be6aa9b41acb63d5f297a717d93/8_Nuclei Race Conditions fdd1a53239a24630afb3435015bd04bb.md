# 8_Nuclei Race Conditions

# Nuclei Race Conditions

- Race condition is when multiple threads read and write same variable
- Example: While using coupon code
- Race conditions can be implemented using Gate mechanism. Example: Turbo Intruder in Burp

```yaml
id: Race-condition
info:
	name: Race Condition
	author: hacktifycs
	severity: info
	tags: panel
requests:
	- method: POST
		  path: 
				- "{{BaseURL}}/nuclei/test_race.php"
		  body: "coupon=HACKTIFY10CS"

		  race: true
		  race_count: 10

	    matchers:
		    - type: status
		      status:
			      - 200
```

The code above is an example of how race conditions can be implemented using the Gate mechanism, specifically with Turbo Intruder in Burp. The YAML code defines a race condition check by sending ten requests to a test_race.php endpoint with a coupon code parameter, and matching for a 200 status response.
