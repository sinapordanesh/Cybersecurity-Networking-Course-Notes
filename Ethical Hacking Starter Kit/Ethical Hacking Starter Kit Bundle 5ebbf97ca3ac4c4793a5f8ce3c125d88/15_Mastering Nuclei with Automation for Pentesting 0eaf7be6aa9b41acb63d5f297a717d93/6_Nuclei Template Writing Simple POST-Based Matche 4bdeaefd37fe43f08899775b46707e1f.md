```

The code above is a YAML code block for a Simple POST-Based Matcher. In this matcher, a POST request is sent to a specified URL with a body containing the search term "Apple". The headers for the request are also specified. The matcher then checks if the response body contains the word "Apple" and if the response status is 200. If both conditions are met, the matcher will trigger a match.

This YAML code block can be used in conjunction with the Nuclei scanner to automate security testing and vulnerability scanning.

```

The selected text is a YAML code block that defines a Simple POST-Based Matcher for security testing and vulnerability scanning. The code block specifies a POST request with a specific URL and search term in the request body. The headers for the request are also defined, including the Content-Type and Accept headers.

The matcher checks if the response body contains the word "Apple" and if the response status is 200. The "and" condition applied to the matchers means that both conditions must be met for the matcher to trigger a match.

The code block has two sections: one for the matcher body and one for the matcher header. The same conditions are checked in both sections.

These YAML code blocks can be used with the Nuclei scanner, a tool for automating security testing and vulnerability scanning.
