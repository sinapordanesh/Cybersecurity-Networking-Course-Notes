# Introduction to Threat Intelligence

## Introduction to Threat Intelligence

- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is an essential part of any organization's cybersecurity strategy. It involves gathering, analzing, and disseminating information about potential cyber threats to the organization's infrastructure, systems, and data. The goal of CT is to enable organizations to make informed decisions about their cybersecurity posture by providing them with actionable intelligence that can help them identify and mitigate potential threats before they can cause harm.

## Types of Cyber Threat Intelligence

- There are two main types of CT: tactical and strategic. Tactical CT focuses on the immediate threats facing an organization, such as malware infections or phishing attacks. Strategic CTI, on the other hand, looks at the bigger picture, analyzing trends and patterns in cyber threats to identify potential future risks. Both types of CTI are important for organizations to have a comprehensive understanding of their cybersecurity landscape and to be able to proactively defend against potential attacks

## Sources of Cyber Threat Intelligence

- CTI can come from a variety of sources, including open-source intelligence (OSINT), social media monitoring, dark web monitoring, and threat intelligence feeds from vendors. Organizations can also generate their own CT| through internal monitoring and analysis of their networks and systems, as well as sharing information with other organizations in their industry or sector.

## Challenges in Cyber Threat Intelligence

- One of the biggest challenges in CT is the sheer volume of data that needs to be processed and analyzed. With so much information available, it can be difficult for organizations to identify the most relevant and actionable intelligence. Another challenge is the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats, which requires organizations to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques used by attackers.

## Benefits of Cyber Threat Intelligence

- CTI provides numerous benefits to organizations, including improved situational awareness, more effective incident response, and better risk management.
- Having a comprehensive understanding of their cybersecurity landscape, organizations can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and prioritize their security efforts, ultimately reducing the risk of successful cyber attacks.

## The Future of Cyber Threat Intelligence

- As cyber threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, the need for effective CTI will only increase. Organizations will need to invest in advanced technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to help them process and analyze the vast amounts of data involved in CTI.
- Additionally, collaboration and information sharing between organizations will become even more important, as cybercriminals increasingly target entire industries or sectors rather than individual organizations.

# Threat Intelligence Use-cases

## AI & Threat Intelligence

- Dark Web Monitoring
- Dump Sites Listing
- Vulnerability Intelligence
- APT Monitoring

## Dark Web Monitoring

- Onion links
- Exposed Credentials
- Ransomware dumpsites
- АРТ
- Data Breach
- Leaked CC/BIN
- Vulnerabilities

## General Use Case

- Data Collection: The threat intelligence team collects data from multiple sources, including social media platforms, search engines, and dark web forums.
- Analysis: The team analyzes the collected data to identify potential threats and their impact on the influencer's online presence. This analysis involves correlating data from various sources to identify patterns and trends.
- Dark Web Intelligence: The team leverages dark web intelligence to identify emerging threats, such as stolen credentials, personal information, or financial details being sold on the dark web. This intelligence helps to identify potential attacks before they occur, enabling proactive measures to be taken.

## General Use Case(Cont'd)

- Risk Assessment: The team assesses the risk posed by each potential threat to determine its severity and likelihood of occurrence. This risk assessment helps to prioritize the threats and allocate resources accordinglv.
- Mitigation: The team develops mitigation strategies based on the risk assessment findings. These strategies may include implementing security controls, changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and monitoring for suspicious activity.
- Reporting: The team prepares reports that provide insights into potential threats, their impact on the influencer's online presence, and the mitigation strategies implemented.
These reports are shared with the influencer and relevant stakeholders, including management, IT, and security teams.

## Use Case 1: Banking Sector and Dark Web

- Threat intelligence is crucial for the banking sector to protect their customers' data and finances. The dark web is a breeding ground for cybercriminals who are constantly looking for ways to exploit vulnerabilities in the banking sector. Therefore, incorporating dark web intelligence into threat intelligence programs can provide valuable insights into potential threats and enable proactive measures to be taken.
- Example:
    - Leaked CC/BIN
    - Domain Phishing

## Use Case 2: Developers and Dark Web

- APIs are essential for modern applications, enabling seamless integration with third-party services and systems. However, they also pose significant security risks, with vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals. The dark web is a prime source for discovering and selling exploits that can be used to target APIs. Therefore, incorporating dark web intelligence into threat intelligence programs can provide valuable insights into potential API vulnerabilities and enable proactive measures to be taken.

## Use Case 3: Social Media Influencers and Dark Web

- Social media influencers have become a prime target for cybercriminals looking to steal personal information, credentials, and financial details. The dark web is a prime source for discovering and selling such data, making it essential for social media influencers to incorporate dark web intelligence into their threat intelligence programs. This can provide valuable insights into potential threats and enable proactive measures to be
taken.

## Use Case 4: Companies Tech Stack and Dark Web

- Companies use a lot of software and technologies either on the cloud or on-premise and sometimes engineers forget to update this software to the latest update which leads to a vulnerability in some cases, it might be zero-day hence it impacts the entire organization and jeopardizes the business that's why in such complex scenario's companies must do vulnerability intelligence and monitor the whole technology stack so that the organization can track vulnerabilities and patch them to be safe.
