# MQTT/MQTTS

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight publish-subscribe protocol that is commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It is designed for use in situations where network bandwidth is limited and/or network connectivity is unreliable.

MQTT is often used in combination with SSL/TLS to create a secure version of the protocol known as MQTTS. This provides an additional layer of security for data transmitted over the network.
