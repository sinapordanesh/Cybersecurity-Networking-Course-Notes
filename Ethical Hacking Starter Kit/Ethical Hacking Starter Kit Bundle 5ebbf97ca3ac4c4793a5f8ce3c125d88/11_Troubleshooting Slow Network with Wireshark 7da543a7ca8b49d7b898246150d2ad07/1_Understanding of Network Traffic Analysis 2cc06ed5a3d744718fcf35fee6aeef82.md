# 1_Understanding of Network Traffic Analysis

# Why Traffic Analysis

Network traffic analysis is essential for identifying common ports and protocols used, building a baseline for our environment, monitoring and responding to threats, and providing the best possible visibility into our organization's network.

## Purpose of Analyzing Network Traffic

The primary purpose of network traffic analysis is to understand how a network is being used and to identify any issues or potential problems. Network traffic analysis can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Security:** Network traffic analysis can help identify security threats, such as malware infections or unauthorized access attempts. It can also be used to monitor unusual or suspicious activity on the network.
- **Performance optimization:** By analyzing traffic patterns and identifying bottlenecks or other issues, network administrators can optimize network performance and improve the overall user experience.

## Purpose of Analyzing Network Traffic

- Troubleshooting:
    - Network traffic analysis can be used to identify and diagnose issues with the
    networks, such as slow performance or connectivity problems.
- Compliance:
    - Network traffic analysis can help ensure that a network is in compliance with industry regulations and standards, such as HIPAA or PCI DSS.
- Traffic Management:
    - Network traffic analysis can be used to identify patterns in network usage and help organizations manage their bandwidth and resources more effectively.

## Purpose of Analyzing Network Traffic

- Business Intelligence:
    - By analyzing network traffic data, organizations can gain insights into how their network is being used, which can be useful for making business decisions.

# Understanding the NTA Process

## Performing Network Traffic Analysis

- Packet Sniffing:
    - Packet sniffing involves capturing and analyzing individual packets of data as they travel across the network.
- Flow analysis:
    - Flow analysis involves aggregating packets into logical "flows" and analyzing
    patterns in the data.
- Protocol analysis:
    - Protocol analysis involves examining the structure and content of packets to understand how different protocols are being used on the network.
- Network taps and probes:
    - Network taps and probes are hardware devices that can be placed on a network to
    capture and analyze traffic.
- Network analyzers:
    - Network analyzers are software tools that can be used to capture and analyze
    network traffic.

## NTA Process Steps

- **Determine the Scope of the Analysis:**
    - Identify the specific goals and objectives of the analysis, such as identifying security threats, optimizing network performance, or troubleshooting issues.
    - Determine the network segment or device that will be analyzed, such as a specific router, switch, or server.
    - Specify the time period that will be covered by the analysis, such as a specific day, week, or month.
- **Collect Data:**
    - Select the appropriate data collection method based on your goals and the resources available to you. Options include packet sniffing, log analysis, and network flow analysis.
    - Set up the data collection process, including configuring the necessary tools and establishing protocols for capturing and storing the data.
    - Collect the data over the specified time period
- **Prepare the data:**
    - Clean the data by removing any irrelevant or duplicate records.
    - Filter the data to include only the specific types of traffic that are relevant to your analysis.
    - Normalize the data, if necessary, for example by converting data from different sources into a consistent format.
    - Format the data into a usable form, such as a spreadsheet or database.
- **Analyze the data:**
    - Use statistical analysis, machine learning, or visualization tools to identify patterns
    and trends in the data.
    - Look for anomalies or deviations from normal traffic patterns, which may indicate
    issues or security threats.
    - Validate the Results:
        - Verify the accuracy and reliability of the results by comparing them to other sources of data or using other analysis techniques.
- **Review the findings:**
    - Review the results of the analysis and consider their implications
    - Report and Take Action
        - Present the results of the analysis in a clear and concise manner, using visualizations or other tools as necessary.
