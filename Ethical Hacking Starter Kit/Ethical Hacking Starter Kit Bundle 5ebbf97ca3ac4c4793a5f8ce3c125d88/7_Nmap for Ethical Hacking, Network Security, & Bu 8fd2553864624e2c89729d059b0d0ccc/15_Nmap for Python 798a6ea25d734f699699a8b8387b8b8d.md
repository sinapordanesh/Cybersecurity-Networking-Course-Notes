# Creating Your Own Port Scanner

A port scanner is a tool used to detect open ports on a range of IP addresses and ports. It can be used for security purposes to identify potential vulnerabilities in a network.

Python can help create a port scanner by providing a scripting language that is easy to use and has many built-in modules for network programming. The `socket` module, for example, allows Python to communicate over the network, while the `nmap` module provides access to the Nmap scanning tool within Python.

The interaction between Python and Nmap involves using the `nmap` module to create an `nmap.PortScanner()` object in Python. This object can then be used to call Nmap commands, such as the `scan()` method, which will scan for open ports on a range of IP addresses and ports.

By using Python and Nmap together, it is possible to create a powerful port scanner that can detect open ports and services running on those ports, and identify potential vulnerabilities in a network.

## Example

Here is an example of how to create a simple port scanner using Python and the `nmap` module:

```python
import nmap

# create an nmap.PortScanner object
scanner = nmap.PortScanner()

# define the target IP address(es) or range
target = '127.0.0.1'

# specify the ports to scan
port_range = '1-1024'

# use the scan() method to scan for open ports
scanner.scan(target, port_range)

# iterate over the scan results and print out open ports
for host in scanner.all_hosts():
    if scanner[host].state() == 'up':
        print('Open ports for {}:'.format(host))
        for proto in scanner[host].all_protocols():
            print('Protocol: {}'.format(proto))
            ports = sorted(scanner[host][proto].keys())
            for port in ports:
                print('  Port: {}'.format(port))

```

This code will scan the IP address `127.0.0.1` on ports `1-1024` and print out any open ports it finds.
