# Password Hash Extraction from Windows-Based Systems

After `msfconsole`, use `search ms17-010`

The `search` command at `msfconsole` is used to search for modules, which include exploits, payloads, encoders, and auxiliary modules. In this case, the command `search ms17-010` is used to search for exploits related to the ms17-010 vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

Then, use `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`

The `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` module is a Metasploit framework module that exploits the EternalBlue vulnerability in Microsoft's implementation of the SMB protocol. This exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system. However, it should only be used for authorized security testing and not for any malicious purpose.

Then use `hashdump` command

The `hashdump` command is used to extract password hashes from a Windows-based system. This Metasploit module is designed to dump the password hashes from the target machine's Local Security Authority (LSA) database. Once the password hashes are obtained, they can be cracked using a password cracking tool to gain access to user accounts and sensitive information. It is important to note that this should only be done for authorized security testing and not for any malicious purpose.

Use **Hashcat** to crack extracted hashes. 

Hashcat is a password-cracking tool used to crack password hashes extracted from **Windows-based** systems using `hashdump` command in Metasploit. It should only be used for authorized security testing.

To use Hashcat, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the Hashcat folder.
2. Type `hashcat` followed by the location of the password hash file and the location of the dictionary file. For example, `hashcat -m 1000 hash.txt rockyou.txt` would crack the password hashes in the `hash.txt` file using the `rockyou.txt` dictionary file.
3. Wait for the password cracking process to complete. The amount of time this takes will depend on the complexity of the password hashes and the processing power of your computer.

It is important to note that Hashcat should only be used for authorized security testing and not for any malicious purpose.
